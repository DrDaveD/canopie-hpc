Submissions will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in IEEE Computer Society. Important Dates Submission close extended to Monday 29 EOD AOE Submission opens: June 15, 2022 Submission closes: August 29, 2022 Decisions: September 9, 2022 Camera ready due: October 8, 2022 Workshop date: November 14, 2022 Note: Items are due at 23:59 \u201canywhere on Earth\u201d on the specified date. Specifically, this is 23:59 IDLW, i.e., UTC\u201312:00. Overview Technologies such as containers and virtual machines enable users to define and build their own software environments, and then run them on different resources in a portable, reproducible manner. These new workflows, with users directly participating in creating and managing environments with tools such as Vagrant, OpenStack, Docker, Podman, Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud, are a transformational capability. In addition to greater flexibility and agility for users, other benefits include greater portability and reduced system administration costs. In particular, they make tractable a much-desired paradigm shift in software deployment, enabling an HPC application and its environment to be moved between platforms ranging from development laptops and desktops to exascale HPC systems. While adoption is growing, there remain numerous questions regarding best practices, foundational concepts, tools, and standards. Our goal is to promote and accelerate the adoption and impact of this new ecosystem to better address HPC use cases. This workshop serves as a key venue for presenting late-breaking research, sharing experiences and best practices, and fostering collaboration in this field. Our second iteration will emphasize real-world experiences and challenges with such environments. Scope The scope of this workshop is to better understand and improve user-defined, bring-your-own, isolated, and related software environments for HPC. The most well-known approaches are containers and virtualization, but anything to further these goals is welcome. Topics include but are not limited to: Container runtimes, virtual machines, and related technologies Portability and reproducibility Experience reports, at both applications and systems levels Exascale considerations HPC in the cloud and/or cloud in the HPC Hardware considerations, including GPUs, accelerators, and interconnects Security and trust models Image management, including distribution and archiving as well as registries In-situ visualization and/or analysis Debugging Workflows, including interaction between traditional jobs, non-traditional jobs, and services; checkpoint/restart; monitoring; and resource partitioning Orchestration, resource management, and scheduling Performance and scaling studies New interaction techniques such as web apps (Jupyter, RStudio, etc.) and DevOps Workshop format CANOPIE-HPC will follow a relatively traditional format based on several other previously successful workshops at SC, consisting of approximately four sessions separated by breaks and lunch. We will have an introduction and welcoming remarks, technical talks, panels, a keynote, and a brief wrap-up discussion. The content of technical sessions will be driven by the curated mix of accepted submissions. In the event of a virtual SC22, CANOPIE-HPC will follow remote guidance from the SC22 organizers, with the goal of simulating an in-person workshop as closely as practical. Diversity and inclusivity The CANOPIE-HPC organizers embrace diversity and inclusion. We are committed to equal opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, gender identity, sexual orientation, or status as a parent, among other things. We understand that today\u2019s workforce is more diverse than ever and that the nation\u2019s best and brightest represent an endless variety of cultural, geographical, and educational backgrounds; life experiences; and perspectives. We welcome this because we recognize that workforce diversity, when fully leveraged, leads to the inclusion of more ideas and viewpoints, which in turn leads to more creativity and innovation. When individuals are able to bring their whole selves to work, they thrive and HPC thrives. Submission procedure Accepted manuscripts will be published in IEEE Computer Society. Manuscripts should use the IEEE Transactions format; templates are available for Microsoft Word and LaTeX (though note that the IEEEtran class comes with most LaTeX installations). Manuscripts must be at least 6 pages in the IEEE Transactions format, including figures, tables, and references. There is no maximum, but writing should be concise, and manuscript length must be commensurate with contribution size. We enthusiastically welcome original, high-quality submissions within the scope above. These may describe complete studies; work-in-progress research; position papers on controversial, emerging, or hot topics; state of the practice; or any other manuscript the authors believe should be included in the CANOPIE-HPC program. We encourage submissions from academia, industry, government, and/or any other type of institution. Each manuscript will be assessed using peer review by program committee members (or outside reviewers, if needed) on the basis of scientific validity, impact to the field, reproducibility, inclusivity, and opportunity for useful and lively discussion at the workshop. Review will be single-masked; i.e., reviewers will know authors\u2019 identities, but not vice versa. Authors should not anonymize their manuscripts. In conjunction with the SC Reproducibility Initiative, submissions should be transparent as possible regarding all methods, and when appropriate, they should provide reproducibility artifacts such as reproduction instructions, source code, build recipes, and/or container images. These should be presented in a manner convenient for readers; e.g., prose instructions might fit well as an appendix in the submitted PDF, while source code or an image repository URLs could go in a footnote. The program committee will discuss the submissions and their reviews and select the program over a video conference meeting. Submissions will be assessed as-is, with no expectation of substantive revision after peer review, though some submissions may be accepted conditional on specified changes (\u201cshepherded\u201d).

Overview Technologies such as containers and virtual machines enable users to define and build their own software environments, and then run them on different resources in a portable, reproducible manner. These new workflows, with users directly participating in creating and managing environments with tools such as Vagrant, OpenStack, Docker, Podman, Singularity, Shifter, and Charliecloud, are a transformational capability. In addition to greater flexibility and agility for users, other benefits include greater portability and reduced system administration costs. In particular, they make tractable a much-desired paradigm shift in software deployment, enabling an HPC application and its environment to be moved between platforms ranging from development laptops and desktops to exascale HPC systems. While adoption is growing, there remain numerous questions regarding best practices, foundational concepts, tools, and standards. Our goal is to promote and accelerate the adoption and impact of this new ecosystem to better address HPC use cases. This workshop serves as a key venue for presenting late-breaking research, sharing experiences and best practices, and fostering collaboration in this field. Our second iteration will emphasize real-world experiences and challenges with such environments. Scope The scope of this workshop is to better understand and improve user-defined, bring-your-own, isolated, and related software environments for HPC. The most well-known approaches are containers and virtualization, but anything to further these goals is welcome. Topics include but are not limited to: Container runtimes, virtual machines, and related technologies Portability and reproducibility Experience reports, at both applications and systems levels Exascale considerations HPC in the cloud and/or cloud in the HPC Hardware considerations, including GPUs, accelerators, and interconnects Security and trust models Image management, including distribution and archiving as well as registries In-situ visualization and/or analysis Debugging Workflows, including interaction between traditional jobs, non-traditional jobs, and services; checkpoint/restart; monitoring; and resource partitioning Orchestration, resource management, and scheduling Performance and scaling studies New interaction techniques such as web apps (Jupyter, RStudio, etc.) and DevOps Workshop format CANOPIE-HPC will follow a relatively traditional format based on several other previously successful workshops at SC, consisting of approximately four sessions separated by breaks and lunch. We will have an introduction and welcoming remarks, technical talks, panels, a keynote, and a brief wrap-up discussion. The content of technical sessions will be driven by the curated mix of accepted submissions. In the event of a virtual SC21, CANOPIE-HPC will follow remote guidance from the SC21 organizers, with the goal of simulating an in-person workshop as closely as practical. Diversity and inclusivity The CANOPIE-HPC organizers embrace diversity and inclusion. We are committed to equal opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, gender identity, sexual orientation, or status as a parent, among other things. We understand that today\u2019s workforce is more diverse than ever and that the nation\u2019s best and brightest represent an endless variety of cultural, geographical, and educational backgrounds; life experiences; and perspectives. We welcome this because we recognize that workforce diversity, when fully leveraged, leads to the inclusion of more ideas and viewpoints, which in turn leads to more creativity and innovation. When individuals are able to bring their whole selves to work, they thrive and HPC thrives. Submission procedure Accepted manuscripts will be published in IEEE TCHPC. Manuscripts should use the IEEE Transactions format; templates are available for Microsoft Word and LaTeX (though note that the IEEEtran class comes with most LaTeX installations). Manuscripts must be at least 6 pages in the IEEE Transactions format, including figures, tables, and references. There is no maximum, but writing should be concise, and manuscript length must be commensurate with contribution size. We enthusiastically welcome original, high-quality submissions within the scope above. These may describe complete studies; work-in-progress research; position papers on controversial, emerging, or hot topics; state of the practice; or any other manuscript the authors believe should be included in the CANOPIE-HPC program. We encourage submissions from academia, industry, government, and/or any other type of institution. Each manuscript will be assessed using peer review by program committee members (or outside reviewers, if needed) on the basis of scientific validity, impact to the field, reproducibility, inclusivity, and opportunity for useful and lively discussion at the workshop. Review will be single-masked; i.e., reviewers will know authors\u2019 identities, but not vice versa. Authors should not anonymize their manuscripts. In conjunction with the SC Reproducibility Initiative, submissions should be transparent as possible regarding all methods, and when appropriate, they should provide reproducibility artifacts such as reproduction instructions, source code, build recipes, and/or container images. These should be presented in a manner convenient for readers; e.g., prose instructions might fit well as an appendix in the submitted PDF, while source code or an image repository URLs could go in a footnote. The program committee will discuss the submissions and their reviews and select the program over a video conference meeting. Submissions will be assessed as-is, with no expectation of substantive revision after peer review, though some submissions may be accepted conditional on specified changes (\u201cshepherded\u201d). Submit your manuscript using the SC21 web system.","title":"Call for Papers"},{"location":"prev/2021/cfp/#program-chairs","text":"Patrick Bridges, University of New Mexico Carlos Eduardo Arango Gutierrez, RedHat CANOPIE-HPC is a workshop focusing on containerization, virtualization, and other methods to implement user-defined, bring-your-own, or isolated software environments.

With its increasing popularity, users have started porting batch and HPC workloads onto Kubernetes, encountering some challenges. In this talk I will discuss the recent improvements we have done to the Job API to enable more batch and HPC workloads to run on Kubernetes and our collaboration with Kubeflow to enable MPI workloads at scale. Bio: Aldo is a Software Developer at Google Kubernetes Engine. He is a top contributor to the Kubernetes project, focusing primarily on kube-scheduler and the Job controller. He recently became a TL for Kubernetes SIG Scheduling. 10:00 am SC21 scheduled Morning Coffee Break 10:30 am Momme Allalen, David Brayford, John Brennan, Kenneth Hanley, Luigi Iapichino, Niall Moran, Lee James O\u2019Riordan, \u201cDeploying Containerized QuantEX Quantum Simulation Software on HPC Systems\u201c 11:00 am Claudia Misale, Maurizio Drocco, Daniel Milroy, Carlos Eduardo Arango Gutierrez, Stephen Herbein, Dong Ahn, Yoonho Park, \u201cIt\u2019s a Scheduling Affair: GROMACS in the Cloud with the KubeFlux Scheduler\u201c 11:30 am Lightning Talks Liliane Neves de Oliveira Kunstmann, \u201cProvDeploy: A containerized provenance service towards reproducibility in DL workflows\u201d Abdulrahman Azab, \u201cAnalyzing Unikernel Support for HPC: Experimental Study of OpenMP\u201d Quincy Wofford, \u201cProvenance or Portability (Can we have both?)\u201d 11:50 pm Jeremy Fischer, Mike Low, David Hancock, \u201cJetstream 2.0\u201d 12:30 pm SC21 scheduled Lunch Break 2:00 pm Yan-Tyng (Sherry) Chang, Steve Heistand, Robert Hood, Henry Jin, \u201cFeasibility of Running Singularity Containers with Hybrid MPI on NASA High-End Computing Resources\u201d 2:30 pm Gregory J.

What would the next generation architecture look like? How do we leverage containers to do computing of complex workflows while orchestrating not only jobs, but data? How do we bridge HPC into the 2020\u2019s and make optimal use of multi-clusters and federate these systems into a larger resource to unite onprem, multi-prem, cloud, and multi-cloud? How do we integrate with these resources in a cloud-native compatible manner supporting CI/CD, DevOps, DevSecOps, compute portals, GUIs, and even mobile? This isn\u2019t a bunch of shoelace and duct-tape on top of legacy HPC, this is an entirely new way to think about HPC infrastructure.
